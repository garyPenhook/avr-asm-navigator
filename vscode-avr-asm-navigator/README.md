# AVR® ASM Navigator

Local VS Code extension that adds practical symbol help for AVR® assembly (`.S/.s`) projects.
Optimized for Microchip® MPLAB® XC8™ (`xc8-cc`) AVR® workflows and device-family packs (DFP).

Repository:
- https://github.com/garyPenhook/avr-asm-hints

## Requirements

- Visual Studio Code `1.85+`
- Microchip® VS Code extensions with MPLAB® project metadata (`.vscode/*.mplab.json`) for best auto-detection
- Installed Microchip® AVR® DFP pack for your target device
- `node` and `zip` to build the VSIX package
- Optional: `code` CLI for command-line installation

## Package and Install

Build the VSIX:

```sh
./package-vsix.sh
```

Install the generated VSIX in VS Code:

```sh
code --install-extension ./avr1-local.avr-asm-navigator-<version>.vsix --force
```

## Features

- Contributes language mode `avr-asm` for `.S` and `.s` files
- Hover hints for:
  - local labels and `.equ/.set` symbols in the current file
  - target-device DFP symbols resolved from your project
- Go-to-definition for local labels and DFP symbols
- Completion items from local symbols + DFP symbol index
- Document symbols (Outline view / `Go to Symbol in Editor`)
- Workspace symbols (`Go to Symbol in Workspace`)
- Find References for AVR® assembly symbols across workspace files
- Command: `AVR® ASM: Lookup Symbol` (quick-pick jump to symbol definition)

## Configuration

- `avrAsmHints.dfpPath`
  - Optional explicit DFP root path override.
- `avrAsmHints.device`
  - Optional explicit device override (example: `AVR64DA32`).
- `avrAsmHints.autoDetectMplabProject`
  - When enabled (default), device + pack are auto-detected from `.vscode/*.mplab.json`.
- `avrAsmHints.maxHoverResults`
- `avrAsmHints.maxCompletionItems`
- `avrAsmHints.enableCompletion`
- `avrAsmHints.enableReferences`
- `avrAsmHints.includeDfpInWorkspaceSymbols`
- `avrAsmHints.maxWorkspaceScanFiles`
- `avrAsmHints.maxWorkspaceSymbols`
- `avrAsmHints.maxReferenceResults`

## Notes

- Preferred mode is `avr-asm` (provided by this extension).

## Scope and Non-goals

- This extension provides editor assistance (syntax mode, hover, completion, definitions, symbols, and references).
- It does not compile, link, flash, or debug firmware.
- It does not replace the Microchip® build/debug toolchain.
- Designed for AVR® device families supported by Microchip® DFP packs.
- Best results are with MPLAB® project metadata (`.vscode/*.mplab.json`) from Microchip® VS Code extensions.
